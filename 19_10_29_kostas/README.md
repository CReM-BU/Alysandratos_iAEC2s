Human genome with	SFTPCtdTomato	

Purpose: 
To assess transcriptomic differences between SFTPCI73T mutant and corrected iAEC2s. 	

Description of samples: 
P6 D113 (+10 days) mutant (C11) and corrected (B2) iAEC2s were dissociated into single cells and sorted for tdT+/calcein blue+ prior to capturing. Mutant and corrected iAEC2s had been previously sorted for tdTomato on days 41 and 79.
